# _MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis_

### Overview of the Analysis
AutosRUs’ newest prototype, the MechaCar, is suffering from production troubles that are blocking the manufacturing team’s progress. AutosRUs’ upper management has called me to review the production data for insights that may help the manufacturing team. By running regression analyses and t-tests, I will review production data for AutoRU's newest prototype, the MechaCar, and provide insights that may help the manufacturing team. 

Furthermore, I designed a linear model that predicts the mpg of MechaCar prototypes using several variables including vehicle length, weight, spoiler angle, drivetrain and ground clearance. To create the linear regression, I read the data csv file, used the lm() function to create the linear regression, and used the summary() function to produce the summary statistics.
