# _MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis_
I designed a linear model that predicts the mpg of MechaCar prototypes using several variables including vehicle length, weight, spoiler angle, drivetrain and ground clearance. To create the linear regression, I read the data csv file, used the lm() function to create the linear regression, and used the summary() function to produce the summary statistics.
